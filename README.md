# 🏥 A SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ORAL CANCER DATA CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING & DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to improve the early detection and diagnosis of **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)** using **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)** techniques.  
By analyzing **histopathological images** of nasal tissues at 100x magnification, we develop an automated classification system that assists in diagnosing SCC efficiently.  

## 🚨 Problem Statement  
Early detection of SCC is crucial in reducing mortality rates. However, manual diagnosis is challenging due to:  
✅ **Complexity of histopathological images**  
✅ **Dependence on expert interpretation**  
✅ **Time-consuming manual analysis**  

This project leverages ML and DL techniques to assist pathologists in classifying histopathological images, **reducing workload and improving accuracy**.

## 🔬 Methodology  
### **1️⃣ Data Processing**  
- Preprocessing steps: **Normalization, enhancement, and segmentation**  
- **Data augmentation**: Rotation, flipping, and scaling to improve ML robustness  

### **2️⃣ Feature Extraction (for ML Models)**  
- **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**  
- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**  
- **Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)**  

### **3️⃣ Machine Learning Models**  
- **Random Forest (RF)**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**  

### **4️⃣ Deep Learning Models**  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
  - **LeNet**  
  - **AlexNet**  
  - **Transfer Learning** (fine-tuning pre-trained models like ImageNet)  

### **5️⃣ Model Evaluation Metrics**  
📊 **Accuracy** | 🎯 **Precision** | 🔄 **Recall** | 📏 **F1-score** | 📈 **AUC-ROC Curve**  
📑 **Confusion matrices** were used for detailed performance breakdown.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Preprocessing & augmentation** of histopathological images  
✅ **Feature extraction** using ML techniques  
✅ **Implementation of CNN-based deep learning models**  
✅ **Performance evaluation & comparison**  
✅ **Automated report generation** in PDF format
